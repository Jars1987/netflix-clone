# Another Netflix Clone

This build is a simple UI netflix clone with Firebase Authentication, Cloud
Storage and Subscriptions with Stripe.

It was a lot of fun to learn how to use Stripe with firebase and to realize the
full extension of such a tool as stripe. Firebase makes it so easy to use. The
docs a so simple. I love it.

In future I will update this build before deploying and add it to the
portefolio:

- Might improve the UI design or even do my own.

- The profile page I want to add multiple users like netflix has.

- I want to add movies to the favorites lists for each users.

- I want to be able to click ina movie, see episode list, see details, maybe
  upload trailers, etc...

- This could be an awsome visit card for my work.

- Will see.

- Until then is jsut a simple UI design with a beautifully simple subscription
  with stripe.

Thank you Firebase and Stripe.

Thank you Sonny Sangha for the turtorial. You
